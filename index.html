    <p>
        Use this quick self‑check to identify which PPP dimensions might be most useful to focus on.
        Rate each statement on a scale from 1–5:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 = Strongly disagree</li>
        <li>2 = Disagree</li>
        <li>3 = Neutral</li>
        <li>4 = Agree</li>
        <li>5 = Strongly agree</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="scale-label">
        Lower scores often indicate areas where additional focus may be helpful.
