      <h1>Identify which PPP dimensions may be most useful to focus on</h1>
      <p>Use this quick self-check to reflect on how strongly each of the PPP dimensions currently shows up in your teaching. It should take around <strong>5–7 minutes</strong>. Rate each statement on a scale from <strong>1–5</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> = Strongly disagree</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> = Disagree</li>

        <li><strong>5</strong> = Strongly agree</li>

    const interpretations = {
      D1: "A lower score here suggests that students may spend a lot of time listening rather than doing, or that only a few voices dominate. Focusing on this dimension could involve building in short, structured activities that require everyone to respond in some way, and using pair or small-group work to make participation safer. You might also review whose voices you hear most often and deliberately design ways for quieter or marginalised students to contribute.",
      D2: "A lower score indicates that students’ existing knowledge and lived experiences may not be consistently surfaced or connected with new content. Strengthening this dimension can make learning more meaningful and reduce cognitive load. Simple additions such as diagnostic polls, quick writes, or invitations for students to share professional or cultural examples can help anchor new ideas.",
      D3: "Lower ratings here suggest that some students may not see themselves reflected in examples, or may face avoidable barriers to learning. Focusing on this area might include reviewing materials for representation, checking accessibility, building in flexible options, and seeking guidance on appropriately embedding Indigenous perspectives. Small shifts can make a big difference to students’ sense of safety and belonging.",
      D4: "A low score may mean that time is heavily weighted towards covering content rather than working with it. Prioritising this dimension could involve adding tasks where students explain, compare, justify or apply concepts, even in short bursts during class. This can help students move from memorising information to being able to use it in flexible, sophisticated ways.",
      D5: "A lower score here suggests that students might not always be clear about what they are aiming for or how tasks connect to course and program outcomes. Enhancing this dimension could include making outcomes visible in each module, co-creating criteria with students, and referring back to rubrics when giving feedback. Clarity often reduces anxiety and helps students monitor their own progress.",
      D6: "Low ratings on this dimension indicate that students may struggle to see how disciplinary concepts play out in real practice or across fields. Focusing here might involve incorporating brief case studies, lived examples or interdisciplinary perspectives, even if assessments remain discipline-specific. The goal is to help students see why the ideas matter beyond the classroom.",
      D7: "A lower score suggests opportunities to use digital, physical and hybrid spaces more deliberately. You might review which tools and spaces genuinely support interaction, access and flexibility, and which are adding noise or duplication. Prioritising this dimension could mean streamlining platforms, making expectations clear, and intentionally designing for students who may be remote, time-poor or using assistive technologies.",
      D8: "When ratings are low, students may experience your course as bitty or hard to navigate. Focusing here could involve providing a simple learning roadmap, tightening the sequence of tasks, and checking that key instructions are easy to find and written in plain language. Clear structure frees cognitive space for deeper learning.",
      D9: "A low score suggests that feedback may not be as timely, dialogic or actionable as it could be. Strengthening this dimension might mean building in more low-stakes checks for understanding, creating opportunities for students to respond to feedback, and ensuring comments point forward to specific next steps. Even small changes can significantly improve students’ sense of progress.",
      D10: "A lower rating here can signal that learning may feel high-stakes, narrow or disconnected from students’ broader lives. Prioritising this dimension could involve introducing some choice and creativity in tasks, making space for reflection on wellbeing and workload, and highlighting how course ideas relate to future professional or civic roles. This can support motivation and sustainable engagement.",
      D11: "Low scores indicate that students may not yet be getting explicit support in how to learn, only in what to learn. Focusing here might include modelling your own thinking, discussing study strategies, using brief self-assessment prompts, and inviting students to set and revisit learning goals. Over time this builds students’ independence and confidence.",
      D12: "A lower score suggests that digital and AI tools may be used without much guidance about quality, ethics or limitations. To strengthen this dimension, you could incorporate short activities where students critique sources, compare human and AI outputs, or discuss responsible use in your discipline. This helps students use technology in informed, critical and values-aligned ways."
